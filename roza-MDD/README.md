### Rozana data integrator usage instructions

#### [Configuration file] description

+ db=			`database connection details`
+ gsheetUrls=	`dataset URL locations`
+ patterns=		`data variables / column names` specific for each data source and equal to the corresponding **database table data-fields**
  + parameters=	`regular expression` used for extracting 'parameters' from raw data (measure);
    - needed for:
       1. distinguishing parameters from the rest of the data content
       2. data restructuring  
    - must be modified if new data source ready for integration contains different parameters' definitions
    - use space character as separator
+ sources=		`pattern definitions for filtering the files found in `**`./data`**` folder used for importing correct files and treating data according to the data context`  

  > file content = type of data (measure, litho, ...) is 'recognized' by its filename (analysis, log, ...)

Watch the [demo] for detailed configuration steps.

#### Running the [integration] script:

+ This script, the json config file and [db-connector.R] should reside on the same location before commencing data import.

+ Raw data / source files have to be located in the sub-folder **`./data`**
  + During the script flow user can select specific datasets if multiple files are found.
  + Restructured data will be stored in **`./data/rozana_integ_<date>`** folder which is used during importation to database.
  + If a working connection exists the latest **identifier** will be extracted from the pertinent table in the database with a simple query. That will set correct ids of data entries to prevent mismatches during database import.
  
    If no database is present data entries will be unassigned which will be handled by the DB administrator by passing data through the [id-handler.R].
  
+ Set the **"upMatcher"** variable with _*`dbdetails.json`*_ [path] or use the _file.choose()_ function.

This part is covered as well in a short [video].

>_Tip : Pure script has less than 200 lines of code. If you want to delete commented lines run_

`sed '/^[[:space:]]*#.*$/d' rozana_data-integrator.R > rozana_data-integrator_uncommented.R`

#### Importing data in database

Once the raw data is restructured it can be imported in database. If the database is ready the importation can be launched with the [db_rozana script]. Refer to the [configuration description](#configuration-file-description) to set the connection credentials.

Restructured data is located in folder **`./data/rozana_integ_<date>`**. User will be prompted to select the dataset's source folder before storing it to db.

#### Notes

+ Keep all the scripts in the same location _([config](#configuration-file-description), connector, [integrator](#running-the-integration-script), handler, [importer](#importing-data-in-database))_.

+ _Database contents_  
Importing a table without existing foreign keys will not be possible. For example, new _'measure'_ data can be imported if the corresponding values for `core` and `parameter` keys exist.  Analogically for _'lithologic'_ data importation, `core` and `facies` keys have to be present in the database.
